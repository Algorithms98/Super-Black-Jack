# Rules for Super-Black-Jack
Super Blackjack is a card/dice game that works a lot like Blackjack.
The objective is to get as close to 21 without going over. The player and the dealer are each dealt two cards. 
The player’s cards are dealt face up, and only one of the dealer’s cards are shown.
Before any cards are dealt, the player makes a wager from their available bank balance. 
On the deal, if the player has 21 showing, then the player scores a “Blackjack” and wins.<br/>
In Super Blackjack, numbered cards are the value on the card, “face” cards are worth 10, and Aces are worth either 1 or 11.
If the player does not have 21 on the deal, then the player must “hit” (take an extra card) or “stay” (waits for the dealer to complete their hand). 
If the player goes over 21, then they lose and the dealer wins. If the player chooses to stay, then they must wait for the dealer to close out their hand (a dealer will automatically “hit” on a card if the dealer’s hand is less than 17 (and they will keep hitting provided their hand remains less than 17); if the dealer’s hand is 17 or greater, then they will stay). 
If the dealer ends up with more than 21, then the dealer busts and the player wins. If the player and dealer end up tying (including 21), then nobody wins and no money changes hands.
Super Blackjack is “super” because the player can choose to roll a die instead of taking a card. The value (1-6) shown on the die is the value added to the player’s hand.
